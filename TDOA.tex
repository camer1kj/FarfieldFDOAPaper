\section{Far-field approximation for TDOA}
Although the time difference of arrival (TDOA) is a simpler case, we include its far-field approximation for completeness.

Using the same problem setup as above, the time delay between receivers $i$ and $j$ is:
\begin{align*}
  \tau_{i,j} = \frac{1}{c}\left(\|\mbf{x_j}-\mbf{x}\| - \|\mbf{x_i}-\mbf{x}\|\right).  
\end{align*}
