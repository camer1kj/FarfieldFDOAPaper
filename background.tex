\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}
% Notes:
% Maybe we should it include a few citations about applications which require locating an RF transmitter. We can just steal these from another TDOA / FDOA paper
Locating a radio-frequency transmitter, or \emph{source localization}, is a vital step in many applications. Source localization is often performed using measurements of the transmitted signal obtained by several nearby receivers. Specifically, measurements of the transmitted signal at two distinct receivers allow one to compute the time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) between those receivers. With estimates of TDOA or FDOA measurements, one can compute various other quantities describing the location of the receiver, including the angle of arrival (AOA) / direction of arrival (DOA), the range to the receiver, and thus the location of the receiver in the global coordinate system (geolocation).

% Also, we can we cite some other papers in addition to the Benesty2008 paper? There must be a ton of literature on TDOA stuff.
For a nearby source, simple geometric relationships between the TDOA measurements and the known receiver positions allow both the range to the transmitter and the AOA to be computed. When the distance between the receivers and the transmitter is much greater than the distance between the receivers it is common to simplify the wave propagation model and assume that wave curvature is negligible in the region of the receivers. This assumption is commonly referred to as the far-field assumption~\cite{Cheney2009}. This simplification modifies the geometric relationships between the TDOA and receiver positions so that one can compute only the AOA in the case where a single array of sensors is available~\cite{Benesty2008}. If information about the transmitter is known {\em a priori}, such as altitude (ALT), it is typically possible to remedy the situation and also solve for the range to the transmitter.

% Can we say anything about the limitations of these algorithms? It would give more motivation for us to develop our method. E.g. relatively high cost of computation, numerical instability, etc.
The equations relating the FDOA measurements to the receiver positions are much more complicated than those used in the TDOA case. The FDOA model is nonlinear and depends on the receiver velocities, and so source localization with FDOA measurements is more complicated than geolocation using TDOA measurements. While the FDOA measurements are often used as an additional constraint to the TDOA geolocation systems (TDOA/FDOA localization)~\cite{Ho1997}, only a few algorithms have been developed using FDOA alone ~\cite{Cameron,Jinzhou2012}. There are some special cases where it is desirable to solve for the emitter location using FDOA only. For instance, in the case of a narrowband signal with a long pulse duration, Doppler resolution is finer than the range resolution so that it is difficult to measure the TDOA accurately~\cite{Cheney2009,Mason2005,Jinzhou2012}.

This paper introduces a novel approach to calculating the AOA/DOA using either TDOA or FDOA measurements, or both, by capitalizing on the simplified geometry of the source-localization problem under the far-field assumption. The main benefit of this method is its computational efficiency, as it simplifies the calculation of AOA to the solution of a linear system of equations. In section~\ref{s:FDOA}, we develop a far-field model for the FDOA measurements and discuss a technique for determining the signal direction of arrival. In section~\ref{s:TDOA}, we develop a similar far-field approximation for the TDOA model and present the analogous AOA technique. Finally, we summarize the results by presenting a source-localization algorithm in section~\ref{s:algorithm} and a discussion of future directions for research in section~\ref{s:conclusion}.
