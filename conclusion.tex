\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}
Considering far-field FDOA-based geolocation naturally leads to a simple method for determining direction of arrival. This calculation requires only a linear solve which makes the corresponding source-localization technique very efficient. Additionally, since FDOA measurement data is projected onto the range of the differencing matrix, the solution is naturally de-noised in a method consistent with~\cite{Schmidt1996,Compagnoni2017}. Another benefit of this method is the generality that allows DOA to be calculated with either TDOA or FDOA measurements. This allows for accurate source localization using a variety of waveforms. Extensive numerical tests have not yet been performed, but the algorithm appears to do quite well in the proof of concept tests we have run so far. More thorough testing will be performed in the future.
