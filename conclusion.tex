\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}
Considering far-field FDOA-based geolocation naturally leads to a simple method for determining direction of arrival. This calculation requires only a linear solve which makes the corresponding source-localization technique very efficient. Additionally, since FDOA measurement data is projected onto the range of the differencing matrix, the solution is naturally de-noised in a method consistent with~\cite{Schmidt1996,Compagnoni2017}. Another benefit of this method is the generality that allows DOA to be calculated with either TDOA or FDOA measurements. This allows for accurate source localization in the presence of a range of waveforms.
