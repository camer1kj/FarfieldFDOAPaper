In the case of three receivers, we find unexpected connections between this problem and the geometry of Kummer's and Cayley's surfaces.

More specifically, we define the TDOA map from the physical space of source locations to the space of range measurements (TDOAs), in the specific case of three receivers in 2D space. We then study the identifiability of the model, giving a complete analytical characterization of the image of this map and its invertibility. This analysis has been conducted in a completely mathematical fashion, using many different tools which make it valid for every sensor configuration. These results are the first step towards the solution of more general problems involving, for example, a larger number of sensors, uncertainty in their placement, or lack of synchronization.},

Firstly, an iterative Gauss–Newton algorithm is developed for stationary target localization based on a constrained weighted least-squares (CWLS) criterion. The advantages of the CWLS estimate are its inherent stability due to the absence of local minima at infinity and its capability to match the performance of the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate. To track maneuvering targets, a computationally efficient recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm is developed, which smoothes successive stationary target location estimates obtained from the ML or CWLS solution using a constant-acceleration motion model. In simulation studies, the proposed recursive tracking algorithm is compared with a Kalman tracking algorithm that estimates the target track directly from the TDOA measurements, and is shown to be capable of outperforming the Kalman tracker.},

Prolate spheroidal coordinates greatly simplify the TDOA equations, producing a set of linear equations in the far field limit. The set of linear equations corresponds to the hyperbolic asymptotes of the TDOA measurements. We also develop a systematic approach that associates the hyperbolic asymptotes with the emitter. In the near field, the far field solution can be used to "seed" the iterative maximum likelihood (ML) estimate, enabling convergence to the ML solution.},

Algebraic solutions are then given for the 3-satellite localization problems using either TOA or FOA measurements, where the emitter is assumed to be on the surface of an ellipsoidal earth. Next an algebraic solution is given for the location of a radio frequency (RF) emitter using 4 FOA measurements.

This paper considers this latter use of the FOA data, particularly when three satellites are in view of the device but are suffering from poor geometry or elevated geometrical dilution of precision (GDOP) [14]. This is a regularly occurring situation in the radio frequency (RF) emitter geolocation arena, where three satellites in view of the emitter is not uncommon [1]–[5], [9], [12], [13], [16], [20], [21]. This application includes the geolocation of noncooperative emitters that do not wish to detected or tracked. We will assume the field device is stationary so that FOA can be used in the position calculation. The techniques discussed in this paper apply as well to satellite navigation, but much less frequently, because those systems usually have more than three satellites in view.},

These systems arise for example when using the Global Positioning System (GPS) [1] or generally when navigating using TOAs measured relative to a biased clock. The same equations are used when locating an RF emitter using multiple receivers [2], [3] after reinterpreting the clock bias term as the unknown transmit time. Before Bancroft [4] presented a direct (noniterative) method, these equations were solved iteratively [5]–[7] using a variant of the Gauss-Newton method [8] for solving nonlinear least squares problems. Since Bancroft's paper, alternative direct methods [9]–[14] have been presented. In this paper we compare a new direct method to traditional iterative methods and to the direct methods described in [4] and [10] which were selected because of the relatively large number of citations they have received. We have also made comparisons to an algorithm described in [11]. This last paper is not heavily cited since it was in a conference proceedings, but we feel that it illustrates some interesting points.},

  Abstract                 = {An array of n sensors at known locations receives the signal from an emitter whose location is desired. By measuring the time differences of arrival (TDOAs) between pairs of sensors, the range differences (RDs) are available and it becomes possible to compute the emitter location. Traditionally geometric solutions have been based on intersections of hyperbolic lines of position (LOPs). Each measured TDOA provides one hyperbolic LOP. In the absence of measurement noise, the RDs taken around any closed circuit of sensors add to zero. A bivector is introduced from exterior algebra such that when noise is present, the measured bivector of RDs is generally infeasible in that there does not correspond any actual emitter position exhibiting them. A circuital sum trivector is also introduced to represent the infeasibility; a null trivector implies a feasible RD bivector. A 2-step RD Emitter Location algorithm is proposed which exploits this implicit structure. Given the observed noisy RD bivector /spl Delta/, (1) calculate the nearest feasible RD bivector /spl Delta//spl circ/, and (2) calculate the nearest point to the (/sub 3//sup n/) planes of position, one for each of the triads of elements of /spl Delta//spl circ/. Both algorithmic steps are least squares (LS) and finite. Numerical comparisons in simulation show a substantial improvement in location error variances.},

  abstract = {In this manuscript, we formulate the problem of source localization based on Time Differences of Arrival (TDOAs) in the TDOA space, i.e., the Euclidean space spanned by TDOA measurements. More specifically, we show that source localization can be interpreted as a denoising problem of TDOA measurements. As this denoising problem is difficult to solve in general, our analysis shows that it is possible to resort to a relaxed version of it. The solution of the relaxed problem through linear operations in the TDOA space is then discussed, and its analysis leads to a parallelism with other state-of-the-art TDOA denoising algorithms. Additionally, we extend the proposed solution also to the case where only TDOAs between few pairs of microphones within an array have been computed. The reported denoising algorithms are all analytically justified, and numerically tested through simulative campaign.},
