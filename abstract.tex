Passive source localization is often performed using time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements, frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) measurements, direction of arrival (DOA) measurements, or a combination of all of these. For a source in the far-field, DOA can be extracted from the TDOA and FDOA measurements due to simplifications that arise in the far-field approximation. This paper presents this relationship and the corresponding DOA estimation method. Utilizing TDOA and FDOA measurements for computation of signal DOA requires only a linear solve, which makes the corresponding source localization technique very efficient. Additionally, the method provides an inherent de-noising of receiver measurements, since they are being projected onto the range of the receiver differencing matrix.
